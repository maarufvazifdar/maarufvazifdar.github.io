Projects
========

### [Faby - The Telepresence Robot](https://github.com/maarufvazifdar/faby_sim)
![](/files/faby.png)
- Developed a telepresence robot that could autonomously navigate through an indoor environment with dynamic obstacle avoidance.
- Features included bi-directional video conferencing, interactive user-interface, and remote control over internet.
- *My contribution*: Worked deployment, tuning the ROS navigation stack, configuring Intel RealSense with navigation package, Imu data acquisition.
â€¢ Wrote python scripts for providing nav_goals via a GUI, robot CAD design, prototyping and fabrication, creating URDF and world for simulations, adding plugins for various sensors, navigation package, localization using Aruco markers.
- Gazebo simulation of the robot [Faby](https://github.com/maarufvazifdar/faby_sim).

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
