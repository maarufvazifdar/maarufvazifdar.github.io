</p>

- Developed a telepresence robot that could autonomously navigate through an indoor environment with dynamic obstacle avoidance.
- Features included bi-directional video conferencing, interactive user-interface, and remote control over internet.
- *My contribution*: Worked deployment, tuning the ROS navigation stack, configuring Intel RealSense with navigation package, Imu data acquisition.
- Wrote python scripts for providing nav_goals via a GUI, robot CAD design, prototyping and fabrication, creating URDF and world for simulations, adding plugins for various sensors, navigation package, localization using Aruco markers.
- Gazebo simulation of the robot [Faby](https://github.com/maarufvazifdar/faby_sim).

### **Telepresence Robot for Medical Assistance**

- Develop a robot to assist healthcare professionals in hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic.

### **Food Serving Robot**

- Simulation of a robot waiter in cafe environment. [Github Repo](https://github.com/maarufvazifdar/food_serving_robot)

### **Shamazon_Warehouse_Robot**
- The project demonstrates a delivery robot with autonomous capabilities, static, and dynamic obstacle avoidance. The robot will navigate to a conveyor belt to receive a package and will navigate through a map to deliver it between departments inside a warehouse with multiple levels, the robot can use elevator gazebo plugin to communicate, know the state and location of the elevator, and upon reaching the desired level/ floor, update the map. Finally, on reaching the goal the package will be delivered by the robotâ€™s conveyor belt. [Github Repo](https://github.com/maarufvazifdar/shamazon_robot)
